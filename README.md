Phase 1 includes a web crawler program that is written in python language.
It is then used to gather data from different sets of topics. Phase 2 includes the
creation of feature vectors by using different approaches like the boolean attributes
and TFIDF model that has been used in phase 3. Phase 3 uses the same approach
and the datasets created in phase 1 and feature vectors in phase 2 to compare
different models like price match , reviews. The data is then used to compare with
other companies to do a price analysis, revenue checks etc.. In this project, we
investigated the process of tagging/classifying web pages by applying data

classification techniques for auto-tagging/classifying web pages as subject
categories.
In addition, responses were filtered by search engine or web page ranking
based on relevance to the topics specified.
OBJECTIVE:
● Create web-crawler program for phase 1 and scrape the topics provided by
the user
● Feature Vectors are created in phase 2 using feature extraction.
● Different approaches like the boolean attributes and TF-IDF were used for
this program to create feature vectors.
